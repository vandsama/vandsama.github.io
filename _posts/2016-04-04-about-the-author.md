BSB in Finance from Wright State University '22 and BA in French Language from WSU '17. Experience as a math tutor, supplemental instructor of quantitative business methods, and intern account manager in investment operations while pursuing my BSB. Recent graduate of a 14-week software development boot-camp and currently job searching.

I also have a wide variety of interests ranging from microbiology to astronomy and everything in between, including coffee and reality tv shows.
